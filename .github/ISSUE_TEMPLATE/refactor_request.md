## Area for Refactoring

Describe the area of code that needs refactoring.

<!-- *Example: “Refactor function `parseConfig()` in `pkg/config/parser.go` [link to line / range of lines](https://github.com/your-repo/your-project/blob/main/pkg/config/parser.go#L34) to improve readability.”* -->

## Reason for Refactor

Explain why refactoring is needed (e.g., improve readability, simplify logic, performance).

## Proposed Changes

Describe any specific changes or patterns you’d like to introduce.  

<!-- *Example: “Use dependency injection in `pkg/core/runner.go` to replace singleton pattern.”* -->

## Risks and Considerations

Describe any potential risks or impacts on existing functionality.

## Checklist

- [ ] I have reviewed the current implementation and confirmed this refactor would add value.
