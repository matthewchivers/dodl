# dodl

dodl is an upcoming command-line tool designed to solve a familiar problem: you're in a meeting, a lecture, or someone mentions a new idea, and you suddenly need to take notes. You need a structured document, stored in the right place, **right now**.

The dream behind dodl is to make this effortless: Instantly generate a well-organised document, with the correct template, stored in the appropriate folder, with key information pre-filled. No manual setup, just a ready-to-use document, so you can focus on content, not formatting or navigating folder structures.

## What dodl _will_ do

- **Dynamic Templating**: Build documents using placeholders like `{{date}}`, `{{topic}}`, and more, creating structured notes in seconds.
- **Dynamic Directory Structuring**: Automatically organise documents into the right folders based on context, so everything is always where it belongs.
- **Scheduling**: For recurring documents like meeting minutes, dodl will handle the timing. If today isn’t the scheduled day, dodl will create the document for the next occurrence (or look back with a flag like `--previous`)
- **Seamless Experience**: The focus is on simplicity - no unnecessary prompts or input. You get exactly what you need, fast.
- **Flexible Workflows**: Configure templates and file structures to suit personal and project-specific needs.

## Extensibility (Future Possibility)

While dodl's core focus right now is ease of use, plugins might be introduced to enhance functionality with integrations or new fields. These will only be added if they maintain the tool’s smooth experience.

## License

dodl will be released under the MIT License, ensuring it's free to use, modify, and share (with attribution).

## The Problem dodl Solves

In impromptu meetings or when jotting down ideas, dodl removes the friction from note-taking. It provides the document template you need, pre-filled with relevant data and stored in the right folder, so you can start typing immediately without worrying about setup. The goal is to streamline workflows, letting you focus on capturing ideas, not managing files.

## Status

dodl is in the early design phase, but the vision is clear. It'll be a tool that turns creating, organising, and managing notes into a seamless workflow. Follow along as this vision is brought to life!
